// Arithmetic operators in action in JavaScript

var num1 = 5;
var num2 = 20;
console.log("the value of num1+num2 is " + (num1 + num2));
console.log("the value of num1-num2 is " + (num1 - num2));
console.log("the value of num1*num2 is " + (num1 * num2));
console.log("the value of num1/num2 is " + (num1 / num2));
console.log("the value of num1++ is " + (num1++));
console.log("the value of ++num1 is " + (++num1));
console.log("the value of num1-- is " + (num1--));
console.log("the value of --num1 is " + (--num1));
console.log("the value of num1**num2 is " + (num1 ** num2));
